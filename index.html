            <p>
                I am an aspiring software/game developer making slow but steady progress towards my desired outcome. Despite my passion for development, I struggle with a plethora of setbacks,
                ranging from depression, PTSD, holes in my lungs that just appear sometimes, among many other things. It's not easy, but I try my best.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't let any sort of boundary define who I am, meaning I go by any pronouns and I tend to fluctuate how I sound, how I dress, etc.
                Most days I come off as generally androgynous, since that seems to be the easiest configuration.
            </p>

            <p>
                Aside from my unobtainable goals, I also enjoy spending my time doing other things, such as playing games with my friends, tinkering with old technology,
                going outside when the weather isn't the 9th circle of hell, and hugging my girlfriend.
            </p>

            <p>Warmth is one of the few things worth living for.</p>

            <p>Depressive jaded edginess aside, I guess I have to provide an update. The aforementioned drawbacks I suffer from are all still true, but as of lately, I've found a way to quell them. It's not a cure-all but it definitely helps.</p>
            <p>Turns out, being on sublingual estradiol for nearly 2 years absolutely fucks up your psyche. The peaks and crashes, along with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrone">Estrone (E1)</a> clogging up your system, makes it really fucking hard to think or do anything.</p>
            <p>If you yourself are on sublingual or oral estradiol, you should consider swapping if you find yourself sensitive to said fluctuations. I'm only starting to recover from it now, and I can't imagine going back.</p>
            <p>The impact of unstable levels is severely understated, and as much as some people found the half-trans edgy persona endearing, I'm realizing I'm much happier on stable hormones.</p>
            <p>Hopefully with this given I should be able to work a lot harder, and be a lot happier. When your brain isn't constantly in crisis mode from the hormonal rollercoaster is becomes so much easier to do anything. At least, when everything else is in order too.</p>
            <p>Current Dose: 4 mg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol_enantate">EEn</a>, every 7 days, provided by the lovely individuals at <a href="https://opengatelabs.com/">OpenGateLabs</a> &lt;3</p>

            <p>If you have a problem with me, just remember I'm trying to be the best person I can be today. If that isn't enough, wait another 10 to 60 years and you'll get what you want. Entropy is unavoidable.</p>
            <p>Memento mori, cogito ergo sum, and remember, we are what we create. Everything else shall be forgotten. Pick up a paintbrush, type some code, do something.</p>
            <p>Verify your existence.</p>
